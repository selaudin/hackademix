The aim of this study was to asses mortars hydraulic properties along with provenance of raw materials and mortars recipe. A focus on the reactions between the surface of the ceramic aggregates and volcanic materials with binding matrix proved to be crucial to define their role in the mix design of mortars. Representative results showed that hydraulicity of the analyzed mortars is mainly due to volcanic materials rather than ceramic fragments. In fact, reaction active elements such as Reaction Rims (RR), Interfacial Transition Zones (ITZ) and particularly Ca-rich rims were usually found at the matrix-volcanic fragments interface. Moreover, porosity tests evidence that bedding mortars, which contain mainly volcanic material and only sporadically ceramic fragments have a higher closed porosity of binder matrix due to the good pozzolanic reactivity.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2023.134408","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Concetta","last_name":"Rispoli","affiliations":[],"email":"concetta.rispoli@unina.it","orcid":"","h_index":10,"keywords":["Anfiteatro Flavio","building stones","mineralogicalpetrographic analysis","Campi Flegrei","Ischia.","Mortar","Roman","Hydraulicity Index","C-A-S-H gel","Terme di Baia","Surtsey volcano","ICDP","SUSTAIN","Palagonitization","Basaltic glass","Hydrothermal alteration","Ancient Roman mortars","Piscina Mirabilis","Mineralogical and petrographic analysis","Standard hydraulic mortars","Cuma","roman pigments","colorimetry","XRPD","SSR- RS.","ancient mortars","analytical characterization","Sorrento Peninsula","archaeometry","multi-analytical characterization","Villa del Pezzolo","constructive phases","production technology","raw materials","minerals","zeolites","chabazite-rich tuff","SMNZ","ibuprofen","NSAIDs","green revolution and ecology transition","water","environment","circular economy","C-S-H","C-A-H","Portland cement","air and hydraulic limes","density","porosity","modern age","chemical–physical decay","ancient buildings","contemporary architecture","black crusts","cultural heritage","marble","Naples pollution","heavy metals","blended cement","pozzolanic addition","magnesium hydroxide","mortars","submerged sites","biofouling","geomaterials","restoration","nanoparticles","Roman amphitheater","Roman mortars","hydraulicity","minero-petrographic characterization","Phlegraean Fields","evolution","structure","volcano","hydrothermal","tephra","microbial","diverse","Drill","basaltic","Surtsey","Churches","Sinkholes","Cavity collapse","Neapolitan yellow tuff","Susceptibility","Derwent valley mills","Multi-hazard","England","Coastal tidal environment","Basalt fiber","Recycled concrete","Impermeability","Corrosion mechanism"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":2,"location":null,"raw_text":"Rispoli, C.; Montesano, G.; Verde, M.; Balassone, G.; Columbu, S.; De Bonis, A.; Di Benedetto, C.; D'Uva, F.; Esposito, R.; Graziano, S.

While bulk chemical or gross phase analytical tools may provide preliminary information on the binder type used, imaging methods such as light and electron microscopy offer a more detailed assessment due to the possibility to study simultaneously mineral compounds, textures and microstructures of reacted and unreacted binder components, as well as their interaction with the other constituents of a mortar. This holds not only for traditional air lime based mortar systems, but most specifically also for all those containing cementitious compounds. The use of standard techniques of polarising light microscopy (PLM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on thin sections to identify the binder constituents of hydraulic mortars is discussed. Residual cement grains indicative of high temperatures of formation (typical in Portland cement mortars) can be observed and classified by reflecting light PLM on polished sections eventually supported by staining techniques, even if present in only small amounts. On the contrary, natural or Roman cement mortars, in which the binder was calcined at low temperature, require the use of thin section PLM with transmitted light, possibly complemented by SEM-techniques. For hydraulic lime mortars, either of the above approaches can be optimal, depending on whether they were naturally or artificially mixed. The contribution presents a few examples of mortars made from each of the above binders and addresses additional observations, e.g. the leaching of the matrix by weathering agents.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-91606-4_2","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Johannes","last_name":"Weber","affiliations":[],"email":"johannes.weber@uni-ak.ac.at","orcid":"","h_index":8,"keywords":["Roman wall painting","Paint technique","Microscopy","Salt efflorescences","Halophilic microorganisms","Fungi","Archaea","Rubrobacter","Halobacillus","DNA-fingerprints","Phylogenetic identification","Historic Army Construction Sites","Montenegro","Austro-Hungarian Empire","Early Portland Cement","Historic Mortars","nanocalcite","heritage conservation","calcium carbonate","aqueous nanoparticles","consolidation","stone consolidants","tetraethyl-orthosilicate","ethyl silicate","TEOS","alkyl-trialkoxysilane","efficiency","compatibility","natural stone","mechanical testing","scanning electron microscopy","nanomaterials","hydroxyapatite","limestone","sandstone","cultural heritage","strength","binder","nineteenth century","highly porous","cement mortars","tools to identify","Roman cement","Residual cement grain","C-(A)-S-H","Carbonation","Salt crystallisation","Optical microscopy","Belite","Phase composition","Texture","Marlstone","Marble","Surface decay","Conservation","Historic mortar","Hydraulic binder","Unhydrated residuals","SEM"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":8,"location":null,"raw_text":"Weber, J.; Köberle, T.; Pintér, F.

The results reveal that the use of air lime lasted until the 1940s. It also highlights the beginning of using of Portland cement in mortars in the 1930s, mixed with air-lime, and the abandonment of mortar formulations solely based on air lime. This study highlights the use of finishing lime-gypsum-based mortars until the 1940s and different types of Portland cement from the 1940s onwards. Portland cement was the main binder for the analysed stone-imitating mortars from 1940s to 1970s. Finally, salt contamination was occasionally found in mortars, which generally reveal a good state of conservation.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1080/15583058.2023.2242820","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Luís","last_name":"Almeida","affiliations":[],"email":"lfalmeida@uevora.pt","orcid":"","h_index":4,"keywords":["UEE PA","alluvial plain deposits","Lisbon","bedrock","Quaternary","Holocene","20th Century","mortar","concrete","characterization","Portugal","Groundwater","Water quality","Seasonality","Hydrogeology","Refraction microtremor","Ambient vibrations","Site characterization","Seismic susceptibility","das","Argamassas","Da Estrutura","Deste","Tardo Romana","romana de Olisipo","Geosciences","Geosciences, other","render","plaster","conservation","sustainable intervention","built heritage","award-winning buildings","heritage","durability","national regulations","mortars","renders","plasters","water absorption","drying rates","mechanical properties","open porosity","air lime","lime–cement","Portland cement","compatibility"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":13,"location":null,"raw_text":"Almeida, L.; Santos Silva, A.; Veiga, R.; Mirão, J.

Acid dissolution/separation of binder from aggregate is the simplest method, and allows the determination of the chemical composition of the acid-soluble binder and, after separation, information on the mortars aggregate. It is limited, when aggregate is acid-soluble. A range of significant analysis can be made including for soluble silica that relates to hydrated calcium silicates in the binder, and thus the hydraulicity of the binder. Other wet chemical analyses can be performed on the acid filtrate for soluble oxides of Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, S, Na and K. There may also be a requirement for the identification of organic substances, pigments and salts within a historic mortar. Chemical analysis forms a 2nd part of a possible scheme of characterisation of historic mortars that is presented as a flowchart. Chemical analysis also satisfies requirements for information input to conservation, repair and restoration works on historic buildings for the choice of compatible replacement materials. Corroboration of evidence of identification and quantification for chemical composition is best supported by a combination of methods, including mineralogical analysis methods. All methods of characterisation require qualified and experienced people to carry out the analyses.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/bf02479290","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"John J.","last_name":"Hughes","affiliations":[],"email":"john.hughes@uws.ac.uk","orcid":"","h_index":16,"keywords":["Nanoindentation","cement","good","finish","Weak","Resin Impregnated Sandstone","Climate change","Cultural heritage","Europe","Vulnerability assessment","World Heritage Sites","Surface repair","Mortar","Historic masonry","Functional requirements","Lime binders","Historic buildings","CO2 emissions","Low carbon cements","Energy efficiency","Fuel substitution","summary","historic mortars","characterisation","Art","original contributions","167COM and TC","related subjects","pre normative","nanotechnology","hardness","hardness tests","invertebrates","compressive strength","computer simulation","elasticity","material properties","Slaking","ham","Hill","rise","Limestones","calcination time","Parkmore","Dornie","Trearne","history","architectural history","lime","lime mortar","building materials","China","India","Africa","South America","Mesoamerica","building","stone","rock","masonry","minerals","micro organisms","study the effect","biological agents","emission spectrometry","decision making","buildings","historic","structures","science","conservation","microscopy","materials","application","durability","structure","Performance","Mortars","Related","repair LM","Limekiln","Slag formation","Silicate","Charlestown","Mapping","Young's modulus","Rocks","Elastic modulus (E)","Hardness (H)","Special Issue","Differential Scanning Calorimetry","Gypsum","Differential Thermal Analysis","Precipitate Calcium Carbonate","Mortar Sample","Hydrated Calcium Silicate","Insoluble Residue","Binder Content","Hemi Hydrate","Sandstone","Moisture Transport","Seal Ring","Stone Block","Masonry Material","Guest Editorial","Resilience","Adaptation","Learning strategies","management","Criteria evaluation","Questionnaire","Decision tool","Consolidants","Preservatives","impacts","natural hazards","risks","tangible cultural heritage","historical buildings","mitigation","refurbishment","sustainability"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":15,"location":null,"raw_text":"Middendorf, B.; Hughes, J.

The microstructure of the mortars was determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry at 28, 90 and 360 days, and the results were compared with its mechanical characteristics, namely compressive strength, flexural strength and modulus of elasticity. A remarkable increase of mechanical strength over time was found for all mortars. An optimized grain size distribution of the sand (optimized compactness) proved to be favourable to air lime mortars compared with grain size distribution defined by standard EN 196-1, showing a good behaviour of the interlocked structure but also adequate porosity that favours lime carbonation. A relationship between the mechanical properties and the porous structure was also established: large volumes in the range of macropores tend to reduce the mechanical strength while gel pores, related with the presence of hydraulic compounds, are generally linked to an increase in strength. Overall, the assessment of the microstructure indicates that the packing density and the shape of the aggregates are the dominant parameters influencing the pore size distribution of macropores; however, the mineralogy and related characteristics also have an important impact on capillary porosity.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.07.223","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Ana

The historical evolution of early calcareous hydraulic binders into the present standard Portland cement is a typical example of a product-performance-optimization process driven by the gradual accumulation of empirical know-how and fundamental process understanding. The early observation that a hydraulic binder may be formed when impure limestone is burnt at temperatures above the decomposition temperature of limestone led to the development of a wide range of early hydraulic binders throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Initially, burning at relatively low temperatures (1000 11008C) of impure limestone resulted in the production of fast-setting natural cements and hydraulic limes. Eventually, over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, sintering at increasingly higher burning temperatures of natural impure limestones and artificial mixes of ground limestone and clay was introduced to produce slow-setting natural cement and finally (proto-)Portland cement with superior strength development. Today, the Portland cement-production process consists of an energy-intensive, high-temperature sintering phase (14508C) of the raw materials, followed by fast cooling and fine intergrinding of the clinker product with gypsum to produce the Portland cement. The mineralogy of the clinker phases is relatively complex. C3S and C2S show several high- and low-temperature polymorphs, whereas C3A and C4AF allow considerable compositional solid solution. The addition of water to Portland cement initiates a complex scheme of hydration reactions to form a hardened cement paste. The advent of novel analytical techniques prompted recent advances in the understanding of the structures of the hydration products and the hydration mechanism. Nevertheless many aspects of the hydration reactions remain unsolved. The necessary future developments towards less energy intensive, low-CO2 cements may take advantage of the historical knowledge acquired in the production of a wide range of alternative hydraulic binders.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1180/emu-notes.9.11","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Jan","last_name":"Elsen","affiliations":[],"email":"jan.elsen@ees.kuleuven.be","orcid":"","h_index":33,"keywords":["cuisson

However, instead, this paper focuses on the petrographic investigation of brick and mortar technologies for the production of quality repair materials compatible with their adjacent fabrics. Furthermore, the paper relates production technologies to the physical properties of the materials fabricated, and thus their final quality and durability. According to Cesare BrandiÃÂ´s theory of compatibility (the 20th century architect on whose work modern conservation theory and practice are largely based) existing historic materials should be replaced with their equivalent. This paper demonstrates that polarised-light microscopy provides data on the origin and nature of raw materials, and processing parameters such as blending, mixing, firing, calcination and slaking, and how these relate to the quality of the final product. In addition, this paper highlights the importance of production technologies as these directly impact the physical properties of the materials fabricated and thus determine their final quality and durability. In this context, the paper investigates mortar calcination and slaking, two important operations in the manufacture of building limes that govern the reactivity, shrinkage and water retention of a lime binder which will impact mortar's properties such as workability, plasticity and carbonation speed, and these in turn will determine the ease of execution, durability and strength of a lime mortar. Petrographic analysis also provides evidence of ceramic technology including identification of local or foreign production and processing parameters such as sieving, blending, mixing and firing. A petrographic study of the ceramic matrix coupled to the diagnosis of mineral phases formed during firing allows to quantify sintering and vitrification and thus determine firing temperatures. Finally, certain features of the raw clay such as the grading and the amount and nature of the non-plastic material inform, not only on the raw material's origin, but also impact the physical properties of the ceramic ware.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1117/12.726186","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"Pavia","affiliations":[],"email":"pavias@tcd.ie","orcid":"","h_index":22,"keywords":["Lime–hemp concrete","Pozzolans","Moisture transfer","Thermal conductivity","Specific heat capacity","reactivity","bulk density","pozzolan","mortar","material properties","mortars","elastic modulus","rha","silica fume","earth construction","rammed till","thermal properties","thermal lag","heating load","comfort index","Insulation","Brick","Earth","Cavity wall","LCA","Hygrothermal properties","salt","cement","durability of AA","sodium","silicate","mechanical strength","slag","Na2SiO3","Alkali","GGBS","treatment","pozzolanic","transform","mechanical index","specific surface","surface area","zeolites","inherited","sintering","Hot-Lime Mixing","Hemp-Lime Materials","Quicklime","Water Vapour Permeability","Water Absorption Coefficient","Strength","buildings","land use","3D GIS","Dublin","models in Historic","centres","modelling","digital","diverse","survey","structures","Virtual Historic","Hot-lime-mixed mortars","Slaking","Calcination","Ca(OH)(2)","Hydraulic lime","Bauxite refining residue","Red mud","Alkali fusion","Calcium silicates","Calcium aluminates","Gehlenite","Low-carbon cement","Sustainable construction","Clay brick","Earth block","Illitic clay","Rubbing Bricks","Bricks Used","Gauged Brickwork","Part Two","Characteristics and Properties","u value","physical properties","Hemp Concrete","Soluble Components","Effect of Hemp","plastic","lime mortars and their masonry","sup","stronger","mortar masonry","compressive","bond strength","water content","flexural strength","particle size","compressive strength","water absorption","Flexural bond strength","Natural hydraulic-lime mortar","Bond wrench test","Workability","Water retention","Initial flow","lime","water demand","paste","pozzolan property","amorphousness","paper concludes","magnesium","feebly hydraulic lime","compared to those of feebly","CL90","Mechanical properties","Mortero","Cal","Puzolana","Propiedades físicas","Propiedades mecánicas","Sugarcane bagasse ash","Specific surface area","Fineness","Carbon content","CAD","Cultural heritage","Architecture","Building","Software","Plastic-aggregate","PC/POM/ABS/ABSC/PET","Permeability","Interface","elaboration","batch","respect","procedure","equipment","shiv","Lime Mortars","Fat Lime","Feebly Hydraulic","durability and behaviour","durability","concrete","loss","OPC","Silage Effluent","Thermal and moisture measurement","Solid brick wall","Internal insulation","Vapour permeability","TECHNOLOGY","PROVENANCE","PETROGRAPHIC MICROSCOPY","SEM–EDX","XRD","Ireland","building materials","historical use","stone","Brick and Mortar","Decay and Conservation","historic data","parametric","creating full","scan data","building evaluation","inclusive design","literature review","post occupancy evaluation","universal design","Photography","hemp","Binder","capillary","Made","virtual learning","Europe","Conservation Sites","Onsite Study","Learning Tool","Four Conservation","Study Visits","microscopes","raw materials","water","matrices","medical diagnostics","microscopy","manufacturing","light microscopy","ceramics","models","historic","platform","HBIM","laser","parametric objects","Hemp-lime concrete","Freeze:thaw action","Salt exposure","PC/lime mortars","Bond-strength","Air-content","Water-retention","Strength/stiffness","Strength Gain","Lime Content","Low Lime","lowers strength","PC mortars","Lime mortar masonry","Brick-masonry compressive strength","Mortar strength","Masonry elastic modulus","Masonry stress–strain","Palabras Clave Aislamiento","Conductividad Trmica","Capacidad Calorfica Especfica","Difusividad","Masa Trmica","Permeabilidad Al Vapor De Agua","Capilaridad","Humedad De Referencia","Porosidad Abierta","Nanoporosidad","Production method","Curing","Microstructure","Miocene","Chattian","alpine","del","overthrust","borde","ected","sueltos","terciarios","Vindobonian"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":33,"location":null,"raw_text":"Pavia, S.; Caro, S.

Thin section examination suggests that binder structure and composition are complex and that binder quantity can vary significantly during the lifetime of a mortar. Lime mortar analysis for conservation purposes commonly involves the quantification of binder: aggregate ratio by weight. Many such analyses of historic mortars have generated results suggesting compositions of 1 part lime binder: 1 part aggregate, in contrast to the 1: 3 ratio commonly specified in current building work. The high binder content can, in part, be attributed to the presence of unmixed binder. Fragments of lime that have not been fully mixed with the aggregate do not, therefore, play the part of a binder during set. There is also evidence for dissolution and re-precipitation of binder in mortars, leading to changes to binder morphology as well as net gains or losses in binder content. The presence of both lime inclusions and dissolution / re-precipitation textures within a mortar has implications for any mortar analysis method which relates the quantity of calcium carbonate to original binder content. Examination of a mortar, preferably using a petrological microscope, is essential if any meaningful quantitative data are to be generated.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1144/1470-923601-27","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"John J.","last_name":"Hughes","affiliations":[],"email":"john.hughes@uws.ac.uk","orcid":"","h_index":16,"keywords":["Nanoindentation","cement","good","finish","Weak","Resin Impregnated Sandstone","Climate change","Cultural heritage","Europe","Vulnerability assessment","World Heritage Sites","Surface repair","Mortar","Historic masonry","Functional requirements","Lime binders","Historic buildings","CO2 emissions","Low carbon cements","Energy efficiency","Fuel substitution","summary","historic mortars","characterisation","Art","original contributions","167COM and TC","related subjects","pre normative","nanotechnology","hardness","hardness tests","invertebrates","compressive strength","computer simulation","elasticity","material properties","Slaking","ham","Hill","rise","Limestones","calcination time","Parkmore","Dornie","Trearne","history","architectural history","lime","lime mortar","building materials","China","India","Africa","South America","Mesoamerica","building","stone","rock","masonry","minerals","micro organisms","study the effect","biological agents","emission spectrometry","decision making","buildings","historic","structures","science","conservation","microscopy","materials","application","durability","structure","Performance","Mortars","Related","repair LM","Limekiln","Slag formation","Silicate","Charlestown","Mapping","Young's modulus","Rocks","Elastic modulus (E)","Hardness (H)","Special Issue","Differential Scanning Calorimetry","Gypsum","Differential Thermal Analysis","Precipitate Calcium Carbonate","Mortar Sample","Hydrated Calcium Silicate","Insoluble Residue","Binder Content","Hemi Hydrate","Sandstone","Moisture Transport","Seal Ring","Stone Block","Masonry Material","Guest Editorial","Resilience","Adaptation","Learning strategies","management","Criteria evaluation","Questionnaire","Decision tool","Consolidants","Preservatives","impacts","natural hazards","risks","tangible cultural heritage","historical buildings","mitigation","refurbishment","sustainability"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":35,"location":null,"raw_text":"Leslie, A.
